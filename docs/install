Kojoney2 - A honeypot that emulates a secure shell (SSH) server.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
By default Kojoney2 will listen on TCP port 22 for incoming connections.
You should be sure to modify your host firewall rules to allow for
incoming connections to port 22.

If you're already running SSH on your host, be sure to move it to an
alternate port (for instance by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config and
restarting the service).  Ensure that your firewall allows for access
to the alternate port as well.

Kojoney2 has a number of Python dependencies, including zope, pycrypto,
and the Twisted Conch libraries.  Installation is easiest on a CentOS 6
server.  You should be able to install Kojoney2 using the install.sh
script as root.

If you want to schedule, using cron, or manually send out reports from
Kojoney2 use the reports/mailalert.sh script, or you can generate the
report output simply using the reports/kojreport.py program.
