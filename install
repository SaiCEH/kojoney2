-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  You should simply be able to run the install.bash script
2.  If you want to install manually first create a MySQL user for kojoney, 
    and create a database to use.
3.  When this is done, modify the first line of create_tables.sql to use your
    database (default is kojoney) and run it.
4.  Modify coret_config.py to contain any settings changes you may want, being
    sure to add your mysql user, password, host, and database name.
5.  If you want e-mail alerts, be sure to change the address in 
    /opt/kojoney/reports/mailalert.bash.
